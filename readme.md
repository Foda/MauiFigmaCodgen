## Features

This plugin supports codegen to XAML for the following "nodes":

* Automatic generation of `SolidColorBrush` resources for objects that have defined colors
* Frame -> Border
* Component -> Border
* Instance -> Border
* Text -> Label
* Rectangle -> Rectangle


### TODO

* Rearchitect code to make it easier to add types because it's currently a hacked together mess ðŸ™‚
  - Better "parsers" for each mixin (ie: `DimensionAndPositionMixin`, `MinimalFillsMixin`). This gets tricky because some XAML types have different named properties for the same thing ie: `Rectangle.Fill` and `Border.Background`
* Gradients
* Layouts (grids, stacks, alignment, etc)
* Effects (shadows, etc)
* Export to `ResourceDictionary`
* Export to `Style`
